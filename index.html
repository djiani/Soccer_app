        <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is an important and often misunderstood aspect of the web design industry. Search engine findability is obviously an important factor in the success of any site. You want a person who is conducting a search for the terms that match the products or services that your company offers to find your website, right?  That makes perfect sense, but the application of SEO practices is unfortunately open to abuse and outright scams, either by outdated practicioners who are not up-to-date on he latest trends and industry best practices, or actual scam artists who are out to take your money in exchange for services that could actually harm, rather than help, your website.</p>
